    <h5 id="third-div-text"><p>Friedrich August Kekulé, later Friedrich August Kekule von Stradonitz, was a German organic chemist. 
From the 1850s until his death, Kekulé was one of the most prominent chemists in Europe, especially in theoretical chemistry. 
He was the principal founder of the theory of chemical structure and in particular the Kekulé structure of benzene.</p>
<p>The son of a civil servant, Kekulé was born in Darmstadt, the capital of the Grand Duchy of Hesse. 
After graduating from secondary school (the Grand Ducal Gymnasium in Darmstadt), in the fall of 1847 he entered the University of Giessen, with the intention of studying architecture. 
After hearing the lectures of Justus von Liebig in his first semester, he decided to study chemistry. 
Following four years of study in Giessen and a brief compulsory military service, he took temporary assistantships in Paris (1851–52), in Chur, Switzerland (1852–53), and in London (1853–55), where he was decisively influenced by Alexander Williamson. 
His Giessen doctoral degree was awarded in the summer of 1852.</p>
<p>Kekulé's most famous work was on the structure of benzene. 
In 1865 Kekulé published a paper in French (for he was then still in Belgium) suggesting that the structure contained a six-membered ring of carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds. 
The following year he published a much longer paper in German on the same subject.</p>
<p>The new understanding of benzene, and hence of all aromatic compounds, proved to be so important for both pure and applied chemistry after 1865 that in 1890 the German Chemical Society organized an elaborate appreciation in Kekulé's honor, celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of his first benzene paper. 
Here Kekulé spoke of the creation of the theory. 
He said that he had discovered the ring shape of the benzene molecule after having a reverie or day-dream of a snake seizing its own tail (this is an ancient symbol known as the ouroboros).</p>
<p>In 1895 Kekulé was ennobled by Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, giving him the right to add "von Stradonitz" to his name, referring to a possession of his patrilineal ancestors in Stradonice, Bohemia. 
This title was used by his son, genealogist Stephan Kekulé von Stradonitz. Of the first five Nobel Prizes in Chemistry, Kekulé's students won three: van 't Hoff in 1901, Fischer in 1902 and Baeyer in 1905.
<p>A larger-than-life size monument of Kekulé is situated in front of the former Chemical Institute at the University of Bonn. His monument is often decorated by students.</p>
